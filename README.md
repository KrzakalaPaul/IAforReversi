# IAForReversi

Implementing various RL agents playing Reversi to illustrate the RL course.

## Current level

The current best agent (MCTS + linear evaluation function) reach an Strong Amateur level.

Benchmarking is done by playing against Forest (https://ocasile.pagesperso-orange.fr/forest.htm).

## Plan for the future

I plan to leverage Deep Architectures to reach at least Expert level.


## Description of the code

-> 'reversi' implements the game, rules and heuristics.\
-> 'display' implements the graphic interface \
-> 'agents' define de various agents (random, human, MCTS, greedy...)
-> 'arenas' implements high level class for match between agents
-> 'training' deal with the training of the agents/evaluation functions
